## Go in React

  I originally intended to create a Go app, forgot about it then decided to do a blog. But when I remembered I pivoted. No biggie since most everything I did prior translated well. My intention was to have a place where you could play go with people, watch games and talk, on forums and such.

## Issues
  Getting ahold of the username from firebase. Getting the go board to render correctly. Styling, that durn css can be a pain in the patootie. 

## Future Features
  Get it lookin right. Spin up the forums and image storage for the profile pictures. Make the user experience smoother. . Work up a win and point checker. A win game function. Forums. Chat. Being able to join games and watch them play out in real time.
